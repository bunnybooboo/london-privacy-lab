# How To Interact

David's currently testing [Riot Chat](https://riot.im) (previously known as) which is a FOSS decentralised chat based on Matrix. It intergrates with Slack and IRC. If all goes well during this beta we may use this in future.

# Code of Conduct

These Privacy Lab events are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately.

Event staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.

In the event of a breach of these rules or if you have any questions, concerns, or requests please contact David Ross (sw1ayfe at gmail dot com - [GPG Key](https://gpg.mozilla.org/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x18E9B7E11B29C1CC)) or escalate Stacy Martin (smartin at mozilla dot com)
