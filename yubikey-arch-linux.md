#Setting up Yubikey 4 on Arch Linux

Documentation seemed to be all over the place. Compiling this file to archive for myself, to potentially present at a future Privacy Lab event, and equally to assist others seeking the same information.

1. Open a terminal and enter `sudo pacman -Sy`
2. Enter your password
3. `sudo pacman -S pcsc-tools yubikey-personalization-gui libu2f-host`
4. `echo 'KERNEL=="hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", MODE="0664", GROUP="users", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2581", ATTRS{idProduct}=="f1d0"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/10-security-key.rules`
5. reboot
6. [Optional Step] In Firefox you will need to add [this extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/u2f-support-add-on/). U2F is expected in a future version. as of 20170218 there is a [live bounty](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/10401143-implement-the-fido-alliance-u2f-javascript-api/) if you're a Javascript Developer who could help implement the FIDO U2F API
7. **Open the 'Yubikey Personalization Tool'**
8. Insert your Yubikey
9. You should see in the top right text change from `No Yubikey inserted` to `Yubikey is inserted`
10. Your Yubikey has 2 slots for data. Mine came with just 1 installed. I wanted to create my own, so..
11. **To regenerate the OTP configuration**
11. In the menu select `Yubico OTP` to edit the One Time Password preferences
12. Select `Quick`
13. Select `Configure Slot 1` [The OTP *must* be in slot 1]
14. Select `Regenerate` [to create new OTP parameters]
15. Select `Write Configuration`
16. You will be given the option to backup these changes to a CSV file [we'll lock this with a secure password later]. You do not have to do this, but having lost GPG key access in the past, I highly recommend you do
17. **Now you'll [optionally] upload to the Yubico website**
18. Select `Upload to Yubico`
19. typing the rest out right now.. 22:24 UTC
